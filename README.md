## Getting Started
To get started with MotionCraft, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Connect your MPU6050 sensor to your Arduino Uno as follows:
   - VCC pin of MPU6050 to 5V pin on Arduino Uno.
   - GND pin of MPU6050 to GND pin on Arduino Uno.
   - SDA pin of MPU6050 to A4 pin on Arduino Uno.
   - SCL pin of MPU6050 to A5 pin on Arduino Uno.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the code to set up your motion gaming controller.
5. Calibration to the major games would be provided by me if you have any other query then you can contact me with email mentioned below.
6. Default instructions for any game would be 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' , i.e whenever you will tilt the controller forward, left, backward(brake) or right it will move accordingly.
